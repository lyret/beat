# The Beat language

This is very much a work in progress. Thank you for stopping by. Beat will be a a weird mix between a markup- and programing language. In the long run I also want to build a runtime environment for creating complex applications.

## Syntax example

```
Comming soon...
```

## Running

### Requirements
```
npm install
```
Requires `typescript` and `ts-node` globaly to run.

Tested with:
```
ts-node v6.0.3
node v8.11.4
typescript v2.8.1
```

### Steps to run

You need to create a `input.txt` for entering 

A `launch.json` with debugging support for vscode is included. Just load up the workspace folder and run the debugger.

Also you can run manually with `ts-node index.ts`.

### What to expect

At the moment some debug output will be generated from each run. Also a `syntax.html` file is creating describing the language.
